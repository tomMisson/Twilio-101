# Twilio-101
Workshop: Twilio 101 - An intro to SMS and voice. Code and snippets for the my Twilio 101 workshop.  

## Delivery tips
You can use the snippets to speed up delivery by typing the name in the prefix in. The slides, which can be found [here](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1J2gvOEnEHCr5YwHwrteUc6w8xcaKRuUNUPBscZjmIxU/edit?usp=sharing) have speakers notes in and generally dictate the flow of the workshop.  
  
This can be given in a kind of "show and tell" fashion or a code along session if all attendees have credit. **PLEASE NOTE** phone numbers in this talk will not work and will need to be set up prior to the talk.  
  
See demo.xml in the repo for the code for the call demo
